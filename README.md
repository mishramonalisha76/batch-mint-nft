<b>Inspiration</b><br/>
We have been part of organizing events for users which can be a quiz competition or meme contest. And to every user, we wanted to mint a NFT as a proof of participation. Now, the problem is that we had to manually deploy contract and mint NFT for each of user. It was really painful and took lot of time and efforts. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>
What it does</b><br/>
The a3 main features of Mintos are:
1. Accessible to both devs and non-devs
2. Deploy a NFT contract with couple of clicks
3. Transfer NFTs to the users just by uploading a CSV file.
4. Expand on the use of the contract by calling the contract functions
<br/>
